# Web2All template

This package is a wrapper for Savant (`saltybeagle/savant3`) for the web2all/framework ([https://github.com/web2all/framework](https://github.com/web2all/framework)). It used to be proprietary software but now it has been released to the public domain under a MIT license.

The Web2All framework is no longer actively maintained. Most likely this adodb wrapper is only of interest if you own software created by Web2All B.V. which was built using this framework.

## What does it do ##

This is the template system used by Web2All projects, it is based on Savant (2 or 3). It also includes a list of template modifiers which are basically plugins for modifying template variables.

## License ##

Web2All adodb is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license ([https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "license")).
